maybe rename this repo jmarq.github.io, as that is the url jmarq.github.com gets rerouted to.
jekyll for static site generation seems to be pretty effective and quickly usable.
need to read up on how github pages process jekyll sites.  I know there is some sort of special hook-in,
maybe it is automatic?
the photo in the background take a while to load, some optimization for web use could help.
or maybe scratch the idea of the big photo in the back and go with something a little more 
load-friendly.


James Marquardt's GitHub homepage

As of (2/19/2013) the content and link are too far below the welcome heading
I've loaded it a few times and the content begins below the "fold".
"Normally" it is not, but I had been browsing with increased text size.
Many people do this, below the fold main content seems like bad practice.
