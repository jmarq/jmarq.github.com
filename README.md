James Marquardt's GitHub homepage

As of (2/19/2013) the content and link are too far below the welcome heading
I've loaded it a few times and the content begins below the "fold".
"Normally" it is not, but I had been browsing with increased text size.
Many people do this, below the fold main content seems like bad practice.
