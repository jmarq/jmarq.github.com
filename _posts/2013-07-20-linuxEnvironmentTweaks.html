Linux (I use the Ubuntu distribution as my primary operating system) is highly configurable, and a lot of dedicated people are working at all hours to create new ways to take advantage of your computer's capabilities.  I've recently given my setup a few cosmetic tweaks.
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://xmonad.org">xmonad</a>
		<p>I'm most excited about this addition. Xmonad is a window manager that is responsible for the layout of the windows on your screen.  When you open new windows, xmonad will fit them into your current arrangement so that screen space is used very efficiently.  Very handy if you often have multiple terminals open</p>

	<li>
		<a href="http://t.co/lE3yPWS1ix">solarized color scheme</a>
		<p>This guy, Ethan Schoonover, has spent a lot of time studying, thinking about, and tweaking color schemes for text on computers.  Solarized is a popular and well thought-out scheme, and on its site you can find out how to install it in all sorts of editors, terminals, and whatnot.  Combined with xmonad, solarized (I prefer the dark flavor) has my terminals looking sharp.</p>

		<a href="http://t.co/XAZQVX1XRE">Redshift</a>
		<p>What'll they think of next?  This software, once you feed it your location, figures out what the natural light should be like in your neck of the woods at the current time.  With this in mind (er...memory), it sets the color temperature of your monitor accordingly.  Evidently having a duller redder monitor at night can help your eyesight and sleep pattern.</p>
