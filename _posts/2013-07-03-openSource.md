I've been using open source software to create this blog

what kind?

Ubuntu Linux 12.10 as an operating system

node.js and grunt for server-side automation

sass for css preprocessing, jekyll to generate the static pages that make up the site, ruby to run both sass and jekyll

vim, the classic text editor

though the site is hosted on github, I've used my local apache server software for testing.  

Jquery and its available plugins are used here and there for presentation elements

With the amount of freely available open-source products out there, a lot of productivity and learning can take place
