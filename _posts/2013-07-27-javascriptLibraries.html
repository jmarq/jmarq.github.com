<p>Lately there have been a bunch of javascript libraries that I've been wanting to explore.  Here are a few that look useful:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://popcornjs.org/"><h2>Popcorn.js</h2></a>
		<p>
		This library is for interacting with multimedia, videos especially.  You can set up events that fire when an embedded youtube video reaches certain points or when it is paused or played, things like that.  When the video reaches the scary part, dim the page background to set the mood.  When the video is paused, show an annoying ad.  Imagine the possibilities...
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://threejs.org/"><h2>Three.js</h2></a>
		<p>
		  3D rendering in the browser.  Easy to follow syntax.  Hardware acceleration capabilities.  Gosh.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/"><h2>Hammer.js</h2></a>
		<p>Code that supports touch gestures. Multitouch, drag, pinch, etc. I've been making some data visualizations that require the mouse for hovering and interaction.  I think that if I applied gesture/touch events to the elements in the charts, fingers could take the place of a cursor. </p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully I can use more libraries like these to produce some enjoyable interactive web experiences</p>
