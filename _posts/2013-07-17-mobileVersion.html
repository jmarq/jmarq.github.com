I was thinking about how the templating behind this blog works, and realized that it shouldn't be too hard to make a jquery-mobile version.  The entire blog would be in a single html page, separated into page divs to be processed by jquery mobile.  Maybe, since my posts include scripts and dynamic data, having the whole blog in one file could cause mysterious errors.
