title: changing git user name and email
---

I noticed the changes I was pushing to my github repositories weren't showing up
on the little graph that charts my github activity.  Maybe my local git user that was making the pushes did not match up with my github information.  I changed my local git user name with 

git config --global user.name "jmarq"

and did something similar for my email.  Now I'm adding a post to see if, when I push it, it counts as activity on my github account.
