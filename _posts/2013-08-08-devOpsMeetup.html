I'm excited because in about an hour I will be attending a local meetup group for coding enthusiasts.  The subject of this particular meeting will be DevOps (Developer Operations).  DevOps, as far as I know, which isn't very far, deals with the process of facilitating the creation of viable software products in a timely manner.  My idea of what it entails is pretty broad, so I'm hoping I can get some insight from some local professionals as to how I can apply the ideas involved to my work as an aspiring web developer.

Gotta get ready to head over to the library, hopefully I'll come home with some new fodder for this blog!  Well, along with some practical developer skills as well ;-)
