<h2>So what is this?</h2>
<p>
This blog is a work in progress, and will be for a while.  I'm using it to practice with Jekyll static site generation and static sites in general.  Also, it is hosted on github and the whole thing is actually a git repository.  To make updates, I add a new post file and commit the changes to the repo and push it to github.  Since the blog has version control in its blood, I figure I'll just keep tweaking things on it and experimenting with new techniques.  If anything gets too terrible I can always roll back to earlier commits.  Early on, you can bet that several of the posts will be about working on the blog itself.  I want to use this web space to post thoughts/ideas/samples/etc. having to do with my web development experience, and exploring this blogging platform's capabilities is one of my main current projects.
