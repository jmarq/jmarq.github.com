<p>
I've been trying to get to know the D3 visualization library for javascript.  Here are some links that have come in handy.
<ul>
  <li>
  	<h2><a href="http://phrogz.net/js/d3-playground/#VerticalBars_HTML">D3.js Playground</a></h2>
  	<p>online coding/experimentation environment for D3 users.  3 input panels: one each for your d3 javascript code, css, and the data itself. A large output panel shows your results live as you alter your code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  	<h2><a href="http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/">Scott Murray's D3 Tutorials</a></h2>
  	<p>These tutorials are the basis for an O'Reilly book.  Lots of good step-by-step explanations for beginners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  	<h2><a href="http://d3js.org/">D3 Homepage</a></h2>
  	<p>Too much cool stuff here.  Nice documentation, a wide variety of eye-catching examples, links to source code...</p>
  </li>
</ul>
