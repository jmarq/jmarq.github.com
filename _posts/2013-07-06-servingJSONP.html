I have a file hosted elsewhere that contains:
{% highlight javascript %}
jsonp({text:"Hello From JSONP Server"});
{% endhighlight %}
This post has a script embedded that makes an http request to that file,
grabs the contents, and executes it as a normal javascript function call. Earlier in the script there is a function defined called jsonp, which will get triggered by the content of the file hosted on another domain, resulting in an alert box.  
<script type="text/javascript">
  jsonp=function(data){alert(data.text)};
  $(function(){
setTimeout(function(){  $.ajax("http://198.58.100.162/hello.jsonp",{dataType:"jsonp",callback:"jsonp"});},1000);});
</script>
