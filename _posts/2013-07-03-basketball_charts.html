<div id="postWrap">
        <p>
                I used game data from basketball-reference.com along with the charting c
apabilities of the highcharts javascript library.  The resulting code is stored in one of my github repos and I have a github page that contains the charts.
        </p>
        <a href="/basketball_charts">does this link to the page for my charts?</a>

</div>
