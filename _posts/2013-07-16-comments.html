I've been thinking about adding comment functionality to this blog.
I've got options on how to do so
<ul>
<li>disqus <p>commonly used service, supposedly easy to integrate with jekyll</p></li>
<li>host a database elsewhere, transfer data with jsonp<p>DIY could be educational</p></li>
</ul>
someday later I'll be able to solicit opinions on such choices using a comment section.
