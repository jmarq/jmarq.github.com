<h2>Capitol Words</h2>
<p>Looking through various API directories I found one from the Sunlight Foundation called <a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/Capitol-Words/index.html">'Capitol Words'</a> that processes the text of the Congressional Record, allowing you to look at word frequencies:  who said what, how often, when, etc.<p>  
<p>I'm looking into the documentation, I think I can have an example piped into this blog pretty soon.</p>
